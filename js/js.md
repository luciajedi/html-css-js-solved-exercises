# HTML, CSS, JS - Jedi Course
## JS Exercises

#### Mix - IMPORTANT

Using HTML5 tags (header, article, main, section, footer...) make a website that:
1. header: a carrousel (like in the previous exercise).
1. a clock on top of the carrousel.
1. below the header: an input that greets you and the greeting changes while we are writing in the input (like "Hi [name]"). Check the event oninput.
1. footer: a colored div that is as wide as the screen.

#### Clock

Make a big clock, centered on the screen, that starts in 00:00.
Use setInterval.

#### Carrousel

Code a carrousel of images, both HTML and JS, without the CSS. The images are "red.png", "blue.png" and "green.png".
It should change images every 2 seconds and also with some buttons.

#### Greeting

Make a website with a customizable greeting ("Hello" + {name}), and the name can be introduced by:
 - a prompt
 - an input + button

#### Finding methods

Make a div with id = "first". Create 2 other divs with class = "second". Finally another div without id or class.

With JS and using innerText or innerHTML, put "FIRST" inside the div with id = "first", "SECOND" inside the divs with class = "second" and "THIRD" inside the div without id or class.

#### Basics

Make a function that...:
- Calculates the square of a given number.
- Check if a number is even or odd.
- Calculates the factorial of a number.
- Returns a random number.
- Returns which of 4 given numbers is the biggest.
- Call another function.
- Uses console.log() to show the content of an array with the months of the year.

#### Regex

Regex, which is a short of regular expressions, is a unique language to check if the sintax of an answer is what we expect: if it has numbers or letter, how many, order, etc.
Search a bit about this topic and code a simple regular expression: we want the answer to have minimum five capital letters, from A to Y.
