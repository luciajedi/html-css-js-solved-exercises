## SEO Exercises

#### Keywords

Keywords are important to improve SEO, but how can you add them to your website? Where? In the tags? In the content? Do some research!

#### Google Places

If your website is linked to a place, you should register it in Google My Business too. Why? What does this have to do with SEO?

#### Authority

How do you check your pagerank/authority? Find some websites that can estimate it.

Also pick a topic and search for webpages with high authority. What would happen to your site if these high authority webpages have links to your website?
For example, www.eff.org is a well known webpage about digital privacy, censorship control, etc.
